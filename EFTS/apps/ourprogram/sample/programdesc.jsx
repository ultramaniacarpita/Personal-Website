               <p> Segregation of domestic waste is in escapable. Presently, it is not done. Collection by the municipal agencies is not done separately. Once wet and dry items are mixed together, segregating them after collection becomes costly and impractical. People find it cumbersome to segregate on the basis of organic and non organic wastes. It is suggested that segregation should be done on the basis of Wet and Dry Wastes. Municipal collection may be done separately as wet and dry wastes by keeping separate collection bins marked as Wet and Dry.
